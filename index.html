During his career in the public sector, he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as "George H. W.

           <p> The one thing I learned this spring is there is a different standard. It's one thing to say you are going to change the culture and hold people accountable, but it’s another to do it. The Jauan Jennings situation was a perfect way to establish Jeremy Pruitt's way of doing things. The way they train and practice is different. How they are coached and praised is different.
              <br>
              <br>
               Some have clearly taken to Pruitt, while others are still adapting. Pruitt's comments after the spring game tell you all you need to know about the man leading this program. He's not going to pull punches and give anyone a free pass. He demands the best of each person right down to the water boy. One thing is clear and that is you either fall in place or fall down the depth chart.</p>

         <p> There's certainly been plenty of talk about guys quitting, body language, etc., coming out of this spring, but for me, what I learned is that this is and will be a better coached football team.
            <br>
            <br>
             There's no question this program needs stability after having 34 coaches on staff since 2015. That instability has hurt development for sure. And while, the new staff has no longevity to this point, they were impressive in 15 practices. For me, there's no better example of that than the wide receivers.
            <br>
            <br>
             The receivers showed significant improvement this spring and started showing some consistency. Receiver coach David Johnson was as impressive as anyone on the staff this spring.</p>

        <p> Culture shock is real and Tennessee’s learning curve is steep.
            <br>
            <br>
            Whenever there’s a change, new coaches come in and outline their set of standards and expectations. It happens everywhere.
            <br>
            <br>
            But the transition from Butch Jones to Jeremy Pruitt was particularly challenging for many in the program this spring. As Tracy Rocker told his DL unit during practice last week, “I told y'all it ain't going to be Happy Days around here anymore."
            <br>
            <br>
            There’s no doubt that Pruitt is confident in his plan to turnaround Tennessee, touting his “much success.”
            <br>
            <br>
            But clearly, change isn't going to come easy. Many on this team did not meet Pruitt's lofty demands after 15 practices. Some certainly did, but calling guys out for quitting and publicly saying that others would be watching from the sidelines in the fall was a major message about where this team stands heading into the offseason. </p>

      <p>
        The one thing I learned this spring is that Tennessee has a head football coach who is all business. He’s not afraid to be confrontational and he’s been very clear about his efforts to change the culture.
          <br><br>
        None of that is a surprise, not with Jeremy Pruitt’s reputation, but the past month has been confirmation that the Tennessee program is under the direction of a man who isn’t afraid to draw a line in the sand with his team and let players know exactly where they stand.
          <br><br>
        Players who can’t take hard coaching or can’t stand criticism won’t survive under Pruitt. This program needs that.
          <br><br>
        No one knows what kind of a game day coach he’ll be, but one thing is for certain, this guy has a vision for what he wants his program to be and he’s focused on executing that vision.
